## Style Guidelines:

- The festive and celebratory design calls for a dark color scheme to help the light of the firecrackers and other animation really pop. We recommend indigo for the background, because while it is dark, it isn't a lifeless black. Its hue will also harmonize beautifully with the firecracker colors. A background of deep indigo: #1E2347.
- The primary color of gold suggests opulence, celebration and good fortune. Use a vivid gold as the primary color: #FFD700
- Deep orange is an analogous color to gold that is perfect for CTAs and other accents: #D97706.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines and short amounts of text; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use festive icons related to Diwali, such as diyas, rangoli patterns, and firecrackers.
- Modern, elegant, and festive design, fully responsive for desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, avoiding cluttered layouts.
- Fluid, optimized animations for performance across devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.
